BASIC INSTALLATION

The complete installation can be done by using the 'install' target in
Makefile script.

  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the source code and type,
     'make install'.
  2. Run 'bfi --version' to make sure bfc has been installed.
  3. Run 'man bfi' to make sure the manual page has been installed.


GENERATION MANUAL PAGE

A manual page, bfi.1, is already provided in the source directory. On
running the 'install' target of Makefile, this manual page is installed
in /usr/local/man/man1/. This manual page was automatically generated
using the output from 'bfi --help' and 'bfi --version'.

To generate a new man page, after some modifications have been done in
the help message or version text in the source code, the 'man' target
may be run. Once, the new manual page has been generated, it may be
installed using the 'install' target.

  1. Run 'make man' to generate the man page, bfi.1, from the source.
  2. Run 'make install' to compile the source, install bfi and the new
     man page.
